      <description>A key challenge in biomedical image analysis and particularly in brain image analysis is registration; human anatomical variability is the norm, necessitating the transformation of image data into standard coordinates. This standardization facilitates analysis and allows results to be generalized to a larger population.
Affine registration, which uses linear transformations, provides a robust initial alignment of overall brain structures. This is followed by diffeomorphic registration, which models smooth, non-linear deformations to capture intricate anatomical details.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of how MRI works:
Magnetic Alignment: The MRI scanner generates a strong magnetic field that aligns the protons in the body&amp;rsquo;s hydrogen atoms, which are abundant in water and fat.
Radiofrequency Pulses: The scanner then emits RF pulses at a specific frequency that matches the resonance frequency of the aligned protons. These pulses provide energy, causing the protons to tip out of their alignment with the magnetic field (for example, a 90° RF pulse tips the aligned protons by 90 degrees from their inital alignment with the main magnetic field (B0), from $ z $-axis to transverse plane ($x-y$ plane), this tipping creates a detectable signal in the MRI receiver coil).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The hypostyle hall within the temple of Luxor&amp;rdquo; is a painting by Scottish artist David Roberts. It shows the central columns of the Great Hypostyle Hall within the Karnak Temple Complex.
David Roberts was born in 1796 and died in 1864. He is especially known for The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia, a prolific series of detailed lithograph prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced from sketches he made during long tours of the region (1838–1840).</description>
