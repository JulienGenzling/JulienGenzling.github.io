The painting is regarded as an example of Millais’s “precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist”.\nSir John Everett Millais was born in 1829 and died in 1896. He was an English painter and illustrator who was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was a child prodigy who, aged eleven, became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London, at 83 Gower Street (now number 7). Millais became the most famous exponent of the style, his painting Christ in the House of His Parents (1849–50) generating considerable controversy, and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group, Ophelia, in 1851–52.\nIn Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure, written between 1601 and 1606, Mariana is about to be married but is rejected by her fiancé Angelo when her dowry is lost in the shipwreck that also killed her brother. She retreats to a solitary existence in a moated house. Five years later, Angelo is tricked into consummating their betrothal. Tennyson retold the tale in his 1830 poem “Mariana”, and returned to it in his 1832 poem “Mariana in the South”.\nMillais was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before Raphael—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate. The Pre-Raphaelites frequently used allegorical images to create a narrative to teach a moral virtue or virtues and sometimes used contemporary literature as inspiration for their paintings, which often include numerous details that allow the viewer to “read” the painting.\nMillais used Tennyson’s poetry to create a narrative for his painting of Mariana, and he wanted to allow the viewer familiar with Tennyson’s poetry to read the entire poem through the painting. It was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851 – the year after Tennyson was appointed as Poet Laureate.\nThe painting depicts a woman in a long blue dress, standing up from the embroidery laid out before her to stretch her back. Her upholstered stool and the table are set before a Gothic window with stained glass, through which can be seen a garden with leaves are turning from green to autumnal brown. Some leaves have fallen on the embroidery and more onto the bare wooden floorboards beside a small mouse. In the background, a small triptych, a silver casket, and candles are set out as a devotional altar on a piece of furniture covered with white cloth beside the curtain of a bed.\n","wordCount":"485","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/1.png","datePublished":"2024-08-03T14:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-08-03T14:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julien Genzling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/gallery/p3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"JG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Julien Genzling (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/taupek.jpeg alt aria-label=logo height=30>Julien Genzling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/paper-reviews/ title="Paper Reviews"><span>Paper Reviews</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/gallery/ title="Art gallery"><span>Art gallery</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><style>.nav{display:flex;justify-content:space-between;align-items:center;max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto;padding:0 20px}.logo{display:flex;align-items:center}.logo-img{width:24px;height:24px;margin-right:5px}.logo-img{width:24px;height:24px;border-radius:15%;margin-right:5px;transition:transform 1s cubic-bezier(.25,1,.5,1)}.logo-img:hover{animation:spin 1s cubic-bezier(.25,1,.5,1)forwards}@keyframes spin{0%{transform:rotate(0)}80%{transform:rotate(355)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.logo-switches{margin-left:20px}</style><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/gallery/>Galleries</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Mariana in the Moated Grange, 1851 By, John Everett Millais (English, 1829–1896)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-08-03 14:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 3, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Julien Genzling</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=http://localhost:1313/JulienGenzling.github.io/1.png alt="Mariana in the Moated Grange"><p>Mariana in the Moated Grange, Oil on panel, 59.7cm x 49.5cm</p></figure><div class=post-content><p><em>&ldquo;Mariana in the Moated Grange&rdquo;</em> is a painting by <strong>English artist John Everett Millais</strong>.
