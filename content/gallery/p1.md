*"Fireworks in Venice, the Feast of the Redeemer"* is a painting by the Italian artist **Vincenzo Abbati**. The painting captures the vibrant and festive atmosphere of one of Venice's most significant annual events, the **Festa del Redentore**.

Vincenzo Abbati is was born in **1803** and died in **1866**. Abbati was renowned for his skill in depicting architectural interiors and cityscapes. His works often feature detailed and atmospheric representations of Italian cities, particularly Venice.

The Festa del Redentore is a major annual festival in Venice, held on the third Sunday of July. The festival dates back to **1577, commemorating the end of a devastating plague**. The Venetian Senate commissioned the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer (Il Redentore) as a votive offering for the city's deliverance from the plague. The festival features a grand display of fireworks over the **Venetian Lagoon**, a temporary bridge of boats connecting the city to the church, and various religious and cultural events. 

We can see **St. Mark's column** and the **Doge's palace** on the **Piazza San Marco**.

The Lion on top of St. Mark’s column was taken to France after Napoleon's conquest of the Venetian Republic, during his 1797 campaign in Italy. It was damaged in the course of removal and transport; lacking wings, paws, tail, and Gospel-book. After being restored by French sculptors, possibly Edme Gaulle or Jean Guillaume Moitte, the Lion was mounted on a plinth in the new Fontaine des Invalides. The fountain, completed in 1804, was located at the Place des Invalides, Paris. After Napoleon's downfall the Lion was returned to Venice, now a part of the Austrian Empire.
